### mp-build returns 'Unable to build pak file'

In most cases, this error indicates issues with building the container image. The most probable causes are:

1. Unknown Instruction :

  ```
  mp-build
  Building adapter [Finished]
  Unable to build pak file
  ERROR: Unable to build Docker file at /Users/user/code/aria_ops/management-packs/test:
   {'message': 'dockerfile parse error line 7: unknown instruction: COP'}

  ```
2. A command  inside the Dockerfile failed:

  ```
  mp-build
  Building adapter [Finished]
  Unable to build pak file
  ERROR: Unable to build Docker file at /Users/user/code/management-packs/test:
   The command '/bin/sh -c pip3 install -r adapter_requirements.txt --upgrade' returned a non-zero code: 1
  ```
The solution for case 1 to fix the typo/command by editing the Dockerfile. For case 2, however, the solution might not be evident at first sight. Since the error
comes from building the image itself, we can run `docker build .` in the project's root directory and look at the stack trace for clues.
