# mp-build

### mp-build returns 'Unable to build pak file'

In most cases, this error indicates issues with building the container image. The most probable cause is:

      ```
      mp-build
      Building adapter [Finished]
      Unable to build pak file
      ERROR: Unable to build Docker file at /Users/user/code/aria_ops/management-packs/test:
       {'message': 'dockerfile parse error line 7: unknown instruction: COP'}

      ```
2. A command inside the Dockerfile failed:

      ```
      Building adapter [Finished]
      Unable to build container
      ERROR: Unable to build Docker file at /Users/user/code/aria_ops/management-packs/test:

      Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable

      ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement vmware-aria-operations-integration-sdk-lib==100 (from versions: 0.4.0, 0.4.1, 0.4.2, 0.4.3, 0.4.4, 0.4.5, 0.4.6, 0.4.7, 0.5.0, 0.6.0, 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.7.2, 0.7.3, 0.7.4, 0.8.0, 0.8.1)

      [notice] A new release of pip available: 22.3.1 -> 23.3

      ```
   The solution is for case 1 to fix the typo/command by editing the Dockerfile.
   For case 2, however, the solution might not be evident at first sight.
   Since the error comes from building the image itself,
   we can run look at the stack trace for clues
   (the stack trace is the same stack trace generated by docker build command).
