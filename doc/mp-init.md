Management Pack Initialization Tool
-----------------------------------

## Purpose

The mp-init tool generates a template project that contains all the requirements to develop a Management Pack with a
containerized adapter for VMware Aria Operations. To build a Management Pack, use the [build tool](mp-build.md). When
calling `mp-init`, the user will be prompted with a series of questions. The script will use these questions to generate
an initial project structure and create classifiers that other tools and VMware Aria Operations will use.

## Prerequisites
* The [VMware Aria Operations Integration SDK](../README.md#installation) is installed, with the virtual environment active.

## Input

### Command-line Arguments
`mp-init` does not have any command-line arguments

### Interactive Prompts
When using the `mp-init` script, it is helpful to know what technology the Management pack will monitor.

#### Project Directory
The _project directory_ where the mp-init tool can generate a project. The project contains a sample adapter, content directories, and metadata. If the project directory does not exist, it will be created.
```
user@host:~mp-init
Enter a directory to create the project in. This is the directory where adapter code, metadata, and
content will reside. If the directory doesn't already exist, it will be created.
Path: my-adapter
```

#### Display Name
VMware Aria Operations Manager uses the _display name_ as the name of the Management Pack generated by this project. The name should include the name of the technology the Management Pack monitors.
```
Management pack display name: My Adapter
```

#### Adapter Key
The _adapter key_ is used internally to identify the Management Pack and Adapter. It should be unique and cannot contain spaces or other special characters. It also cannot start with a number. By default, it is set to the Display Name with special characters removed (if the Display Name begins with a number, 'Adapter' is prepended).
```
Management pack adapter key: MyAdapter
```

#### Description
A brief _description_ of the Management Pack and the technology it monitors. The description should include relevant versions of the monitored technology.
```
Management pack description: This management pack is an example for the VMware Aria Operations Integration SDK project.
```

#### Vendor
The name of the vendor/developer of the Management Pack. VMware Aria Operations Manager will display this information during the installation of the  Management Pack generated by this project.
```
Management pack vendor: VMware
```

#### EULA
The End-User License Agreement (EULA) is a text file that provides guidelines for distributing and using the Management Pack generated by this project. It is generally only necessary for Management Packs that will be distributed. The content of this file appears in VMware Aria Operations Manager during the installation of this management pack.
```
Enter a path to a EULA text file, or leave blank for no EULA:
A EULA can be added later by editing the default 'eula.txt' file.
```

#### Icon
The _icon_ for the Management Pack generated by this project. The icon will be displayed in VMware Aria Operations Manager. The icon image must be 256x256 pixels in PNG format.
```
Enter a path to the management pack icon file, or leave blank for no icon:
An icon can be added later by setting the 'pak_icon' key in 'manifest.txt' to the icon file name and adding the icon file to the root project directory.
```
[//]: # (TODO: Add this section back when we support it)
[//]: # (#### Language)
[//]: # (The _language_ for the Management Pack determines the language for the template source and build files.)
[//]: # (```)
[//]: # (Select a language for the adapter.)
[//]: # ( ❯ Python)
[//]: # (```)

##  Output
The init script creates a project in the given path with the following structure:

### Dockerfile (file)
Contains all necessary instructions to build a container with an HTTP server, the user's executable adapter
code, and any additional dependencies specified by the user.

### adapter_requirements.txt (file)
This file defines all the dependencies needed by the adapter at run time. This file is copied onto the container where the adapter runs and used by the default Dockerfile to install dependencies into the container image.

### requirements.txt (file)
This file defines all the dependencies needed for development of the adapter. This file does not get copied into the Dockerfile.

### commands.cfg (file)
This files contains a list of the commands the HTTP server can run, along with the path to the executable related to the
command. By default, all commands are run by executing the `adapter.py` file along with a parameter that defines a command.
For example, when the HTTP server receives a request to run a test connection, it reads the commands.cfg key for `test`
and runs the process defined by the key value, `/usr/local/bin/python app/adapter.py test`.

### eula.txt (file)
This file defines the End User License Agreement (EULA); If no EULA was provided then `mp-init` generates a template EULA.

### manifest.txt (file)
The manifest file contains top-level information that needed to install a management pack. The content is in JSON format.

> Note: The file must be encoded in UTF-8 format without a byte-order
mark. If your editor automatically includes the byte-order mark when saving to UTF-8, you must remove it.

<sup>1</sup> This property is required.

<sup>2</sup> Localized fields are specified in the property files located in the `resources/` directory. See [Adding Localization](adding_content.md#adding-localization).

### venv (directory)

A Python virtual environment for the project. The directory name is prefixed with __venv__ followed by the display name of the management pack. This virtual environment is created to allow users to use different versions of the SDK for every project.

**NOTE:** This directory is excluded from version control. Users cloning the project will have to create their own venv directory([ venv documentaion](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).

### app (directory)
By default, this directory contains a template adapter. The template adapter collects several objects and metrics from the container that the adapter
is running in, and can be used as a starting point for creating a new adapter. The template adapter uses [vmware-aria-operations-integration-sdk-lib](https://pypi.org/project/vmware-aria-operations-integration-sdk-lib/) to streamline the process of building adapter.
The template adapter has comments throughout the code to help new users understand the process of creating their own adapter using the existing code. For additional guidance creating adapters see our [Walkthroughs](../README.md#walkthroughs) section.

### conf (directory)
The conf directory contains configuration files used by VMware Aria Operations to create a management pack instance.

- describe.xml: An XML configuration file that defines the object model for an adapter, along with semantic definitions for use in data analysis and management.
- describeSchema.xsd: A file that defines what elements and attributes may appear in the `describe.xml` document. This file does not need to be included in a Management Pack but is useful for validating that the `describe.xml` file is error-free.

### content (directory)
Contains all the content included in a management pack such as: alerts, dashboards, reports, recommendations, symptoms, and traversal specs. To learn more about adding content, consult the [Adding Content](adding_content.md) guidej

### resources (directory)
The resources directory contains localization file(s), by default `resources.properties`. This file specifies the mapping of `nameKey` attribute of elements inside the `conf/describe.xml`. For more information see [Adding Localization](adding_content.md#adding-localization).

## Troubleshooting
### Setting log level

Set log level to debug to see a verbose output of the program:
For Linux and macOS
```sh
LOG_LEVEL=debug mp-init
```
For Windows
```
set LOG_LEVEL=debug
mp-init
```
For Windows, set the log level back to `info` after debugging.

### SyntaxError: invalid syntax
The error below shows that the wrong version of Python is being used to run the mp-init tool.
```
  File "tools/setup/main.py", line 12
    def is_directory_or_not_existing(p: str):
                                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Ensure the version of Python that runs the script in Python 3.3 or higher.
