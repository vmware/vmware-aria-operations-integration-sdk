There is no option to create in the VMware Aria Operations UI and export.</p> <p>A traversal specification defines how to navigate through objects by defining one or more paths through their relationships, and is defined in the <code>describe.xml</code> file. Each path consists of two or more nodes, and each node is separated by two bars (<code>||</code>). A traversal always starts with the same object type, known as the root. When creating a traversal, the root object type is specified using the <code>rootAdapterKind</code> and <code>rootResourceKind</code> attributes. Every path in the traversal must start with the root object as its first node. Nodes are represented by the adapter type and object type separated by double colons (<code>::</code>). After the first node, each node must also include a relationship direction, either <code>child</code>, or <code>~child</code> (parent), separated from the adapter kind and resource kind by double colons (<code>::</code>). Multiple traversals can be included in a Management Pack, and each individual traversal can have its own root object type.</p> <p>For example, assume we have an adapter called <code>my_adapter</code> with two object types, <code>my_instance_resource_kind</code> and <code>my_database_resource_kind</code> that have a parent-child relationship (each <code>my_instance_resource_kind</code> object is the parent of some number of <code>my_database_resource_kind</code> objects). Additionally, we have a relationship to VMs that are a parent to <code>my_instance_resource_kind</code> objects. The raw relationships look like this: <pre><code>     VirtualMachine\n           |\nmy_instance_resource_kind\n           |\nmy_database_resource_kind\n</code></pre> Now, say that we want to be able to select an instance and see all the databases running on it. We can make a very simple traversal with a single path in <code>describe.xml</code>: <pre><code>&lt;AdapterKind xmlns=\"http://schemas.vmware.com/vcops/schema\" key=\"my_adapter\" nameKey=\"1\" version=\"1\"&gt;\n   &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n   &lt;TraversalSpecKinds&gt;\n      &lt;TraversalSpecKind name=\"MyTraversal\" rootAdapterKind=\"my_adapter\" rootResourceKind=\"my_instance_resource_kind\" description=\"Navigate from the Instance to the Databases hosted on it.\"&gt;\n         &lt;ResourcePath path=\"my_adapter::my_instance_resource_kind||my_adapter::my_database_resource_kind::child\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/TraversalSpecKind&gt;\n   &lt;/TraversalSpecKinds&gt;\n&lt;/AdapterKind&gt;\n</code></pre> When the Management Pack is installed in VMware Aria Operations, the <code>Object Browser</code> will show the traversal in the <code>Environments</code> section.

a new project. It walks you through the steps necessary to extend an existing Management Pack to add additional data, using the MySQL Management Pack as an example.</p> <p>Extending an existing management pack is similar to creating a new management pack, but has some additional constraints. This section will create a management pack that adds metrics to the existing MySQL management pack's database object. It assumes you have already installed the SDK and understand the tools and steps in the 'Get Started' section. It also assumes that you have installed and configured the MySQL management pack on a VMware Aria Operations instance in your local network.</p> <p>For the purposes of this walkthrough, we will be adding five metrics to the MySQL database object that show the total amount of lock waits and statistics about the time spent waiting for those locks. This info can be found in MySQL in the table <code>performance_schema.table_lock_waits_summary_by_table</code>.</p> <p>The first step is to run <code>mp-init</code> and create a new project. There are no restrictions, except that the adapter kind key cannot be used by another management pack that is installed on the same system. For example, we used the following to create the sample:</p> <pre><code>\u276f mp-init\nEnter a directory to create the project in. This is the directory where adapter code, metadata, and\ncontent will reside. If the directory doesn't already exist, it will be created.\nPath: mysql-extension-mp\nManagement pack display name: Extended MySQL MP\nManagement pack adapter key: ExtendedMySQLMP\nManagement pack description: Adds 'Lock Wait' metrics to MySQL Database objects\nManagement pack vendor: VMware, Inc\nEnter a path to a EULA text file, or leave blank for no EULA:\nEnter a path to the management pack icon file, or leave blank for no icon:\nAn icon can be added later by setting the 'pak_icon' key in 'manifest.txt' to the\nicon file name and adding the icon file to the root project directory.\nCreating Project [Finished]\n\nproject generation completed\n</code></pre> <p>The completed management pack is found in the 'samples' directory, and can be used as a reference for this walkthrough or as a starting point for creating your own.</p> <p>Once the project finished generating, we can change directory into the project and activate the Python virtual environment.</p> <p>Next, we need to modify the adapter code. We will break this up into several steps:</p> <ol> <li>Add a library for connecting to MySQL</li> <li>Modify the adapter definition to add fields for connecting to MySQL</li> <li>Modify the <code>test</code> method to create a MySQL connection and run a query</li> <li>Modify the <code>collect</code> method to collect metrics, and attach them to the correct      database objects</li> <li>Verify the MP</li> </ol>"},{"location":"guides/extending_an_existing_management_pack/#add-a-library-for-connection-to-mysql","title":"Add a library for connection to MySQL","text":"<p>In order to add the metrics we want, we will need to be able to run a query against a MySQL database.

We will define parameters for the <code>Host</code> and <code>Port</code>, and a credential for the <code>Username</code> and <code>Password</code>.

The documentation for this API can be found on any VMware Aria Operations instance at https://[aria_ops_hostname]/suite-api/.

This is the method where we query MySQL for the metrics we want and send them to VMware Aria Operations as part of the database objects. Before we begin writing code, we need to look up some information about the MySQL management pack. Specifically, we need the following information: * The MySQL Adapter Kind Key * The MySQL Database Object type * A way to create a database object that matches a database that already exists on   VMware Aria Operations (usually the identifier list, but the name can sometimes work,   as in this case).</p> <p>These will be used to ensure that the metrics are attached to existing MySQL objects, rather than creating new ones.</p> <p>To get this information, we will <code>ssh</code> into the collector where the MySQL management pack is running. Then <code>cd</code> to <code>$ALIVE_BASE/user/plugin/inbound/mysql/conf/</code>. From there, open the <code>describe.xml</code> file. The Adapter Kind key is at the top on the fourth line: <pre><code>&lt;?xml version = '1.0' encoding = 'UTF-8'?&gt;\n&lt;!-- &lt;!DOCTYPE AdapterKind SYSTEM \"describeSchema.xsd\"&gt; --&gt;\n&lt;!-- Copyright (c) 2020 VMware Inc. All Rights Reserved. --&gt;\n&lt;AdapterKind key=\"MySQLAdapter\" nameKey=\"1\" version=\"1\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.vmware.com/vcops/schema\"&gt;\n</code></pre> Inside the <code>AdapterKind</code> tag are <code>ResourceKinds/ResourceKind</code> tags, and we can search for the one that represents the database resource kind. Once we have found it we can see that it has two identifiers, one for the adapter instance ID, and one for the database name. <pre><code>   &lt;ResourceKinds&gt;\n      &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n      &lt;ResourceKind key=\"mysql_database\" nameKey=\"64\" &gt;\n          &lt;ResourceIdentifier dispOrder=\"1\" key=\"adapter_instance_id\" length=\"\" nameKey=\"37\" required=\"true\" type=\"string\" identType=\"1\" enum=\"false\" default=\"\"&gt; &lt;/ResourceIdentifier&gt;\n          &lt;ResourceIdentifier dispOrder=\"2\" key=\"database_name\" length=\"\" nameKey=\"65\" required=\"true\" type=\"string\" identType=\"1\" enum=\"false\" default=\"\"&gt; &lt;/ResourceIdentifier&gt;\n</code></pre> In order to attach a metric to these objects, we will need all identifiers that have an <code>identType=1</code>. In this case, those are <code>adapter_instance_id</code> and <code>database_name</code>. This means that the combination of those two fields uniquely identify the object among all of the <code>mysql_database</code> objects in the <code>MySQLAdapter</code> adapter.</p> <p>Getting the <code>adapter_instance_id</code> requires a SuiteAPI call. We need to retrieve the Adapter Instances for <code>MySQLAdapter</code> that has the same host and port identifiers as our adapter, and then retrieving the id. However, if we look in VMware Aria Operations itself, we can see that each database's name has the format <code>mysql_host/mysql_database</code>, which should be unique (even if VMware Aria Operations isn't using it for determining uniqueness). Thus, a simpler way to get matching objects (in this case) is to construct the name, and ask the SuiteAPI to give us all <code>MySQLAdapter</code> <code>mysql_database</code> objects with those names. Then we can simply attach metrics to the resulting <code>mysql_database</code> objects, which will have all identifiers correctly set by the SuiteAPI.</p> <p>First, we should remove all the sample code inside the <code>try</code> block. All the code for the following steps should be inside the <code>try</code> block.</p> <p>Then, we need to establish a connection to MySQL. We can do this in the same way as in test connect. In many cases creating a function for connecting that is called from both <code>test</code> and <code>collect</code> is worthwhile. Then we can query the list of databases, and construct a list of database names that may be present:</p> <pre><code>        # Get the list of databases on this instance\n        cursor = connection.cursor()\n        cursor.execute(\"SHOW databases\")\n        database_names = [f\"{hostname}/{database[0]}\" for database in cursor]\n        cursor.close()\n</code></pre> <p>We then query the SuiteAPI for <code>mysql_database</code> objects from the <code>MySQLAdapter</code> adapter, with the names we computed. The queries that <code>query_for_resources</code> accepts are documented in the SuiteAPI documentation, and can search on many types of metadata about a resource. After that, we add the returned objects to the <code>result</code> and to a dictionary for quick access later.</p> <pre><code>        # Get the list of objects from the SuiteAPI that represent the MySQL\n        # databases that are on this instance, and add any we find to the result\n        databases = {}  # dict of database Objects by name for easy access\n        with adapter_instance.suite_api_client as suite_api:\n            dbs = suite_api.query_for_resources(\n                query={\n                    \"adapterKind\": [\"MySQLAdapter\"],\n                    \"resourceKind\": [\"mysql_database\"],\n                    \"name\": database_names,\n                },\n            )\n            for db in dbs:\n                databases[db.get_identifier_value(\"database_name\")] = db\n                # Add each database to the collection result.

A typical test connection will generally consist of:</p> <ol> <li>Read identifier values from adapter_instance that are required to connect to the target(s)</li> <li>Connect to the target(s), and retrieve some sample data</li> <li>If any of the above failed, return an error, otherwise pass.</li> <li>Disconnect cleanly from the target (ensure this happens even if an error occurs)</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p><code>get_endpoints(adapter_instance)</code>:   This method is run before the 'test' method, and VMware Aria Operations will use   the results to extract a certificate from each URL. If the certificate is not trusted by   the VMware Aria Operations Trust Store, the user will be prompted to either accept or reject   the certificate. If it is accepted, the certificate will be added to the AdapterInstance   object that is passed to the 'test' and 'collect' methods. Any certificate that is   encountered in those methods should then be validated against the certificate(s)   in the AdapterInstance. This method will only work against HTTPS endpoints, different types   of endpoint will not work (e.g., database connections).</p> </li> <li> <p><code>collect(adapter_instance)</code>:   Performs a collection against the target host. A typical collection will generally consist of:</p> <ol> <li>Read identifier values from adapter_instance that are required to connect to the target(s)</li> <li>Connect to the target(s), and retrieve data</li> <li>Add the data into the CollectResult as objects, properties, metrics, etc</li> <li>Disconnect cleanly from the target (ensure this happens even if an error occurs)</li> <li>Return the CollectResult.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p><code>get_adapter_definition()</code>:   Optional method that defines the Adapter Instance configuration. The Adapter Instance   configuration is the set of parameters and credentials used to connect to the target and   configure the adapter. It also defines the object types and attribute types present in a   collection. Setting these helps VMware Aria Operations to validate, process, and display   the data correctly. If this method is omitted, a <code>describe.xml</code> file should be manually   created inside the <code>conf</code> directory with the same data. Generally, this is only necessary   when using advanced features of the <code>describe.xml</code> file that are not present in this method.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>The adapter is stateless.
