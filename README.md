VMware Aria Operations Integration SDK
=====================

Welcome to the VMware Aria Operations Integration SDK.

## What is the Integration SDK?

The Integration SDK creates Management Packs to add custom objects, data, and
relationships from a endpoint into VMware Aria Operations.

Using this SDK to create a Management Pack requires some Python
knowledge (more languages are planned), and an understanding of how to get
data from the endpoint using an API. For example, to create a Management Pack for
Cassandra DB, an understanding of how to write an SQL query, execute it, and read the
results is required.

Currently, installing a Management Pack built with the integration SDK is supported for
On-Prem versions of VMware Aria Operations only, but we are working to bring support to
VMware Aria Operations Cloud in a future release.

For a high-level overview of VMware Aria Operations, Management Packs, and this SDK,
see [the introduction](doc/introduction.md).

## What can the Integration SDK be used for?
The Integration SDK can be used to add any endpoint that supports remote monitoring to
VMware Aria Operations. Adding the endpoint involves creating objects that
represent the endpoint, which may include properties, metrics, and events, as well as
relationships between objects.

**Remote monitoring** uses an API (such as REST, SNMP, SQL, etc) to retrieve the data (as
opposed to agent-based monitoring, where the monitoring code runs in the same location
as the endpoint).

For an example walkthrough of creating a new Management Pack monitoring an endpoint, see
[Creating a new Management Pack for Cassandra DB](#creating-a-new-management-pack--cassandra-db-)

The Integration SDK can also be used to extend objects created by another Management
Pack with additional metrics, properties, events, or relationships. This can be useful
to ensure access to custom data without having to re-implement already existing data.

For an example walkthrough of the steps required to extend another management pack, see
[Extending the Existing Management Pack for MySQL](#extending-an-existing-management-pack--mysql-)

### Installation

To install the SDK, use `pip` to install into the global Python environment, or `pipx` to install into a isolated environment.
```sh
python3 -m pip install vmware-aria-operations-integration-sdk
```

### Creating a Management Pack
After the SDK is installed, create a new project, by running `mp-init`. This tool asks a series of questions that guides
the creation of a new management pack project.


1. `Enter a directory to create the project in. This is the directory where adapter code, metadata, and content will reside. If the directory doesn't already exist, it will be created. Path:`

    The path can be an absolute path, or a path relative to the directory `mp-init` was run from. The path should end in an empty
    or non-existing directory. If the directory does not exist, it will be created. This directory will contain a new Management
    Pack project.

2. `Management Pack display name`

    The Management Pack display name will show up in VMware Aria Operations (**Data Sources &rarr; Integrations &rarr;
    Repository**), or when adding an account.

    ![Integration Card for the 'TestAdapter' Management Pack](doc/test-adapter-integration-card.png)

    *This Management Pack's display name is 'TestAdapter', and uses the default icon*

3. `Management Pack adapter key`

    This field is used internally to identify the Management Pack and Adapter Kind. By default, it is set to the
    Management Pack display name with special characters and whitespace stripped from it.

4. `Management Pack description`

    This field should describe what the Management Pack will do or monitor.

5. `Management Pack vendor`

   The vendor field shows up in the UI under 'About' on the Integration Card.

   ![About popup for the 'TestAdapter' Management Pack](doc/test-adapter-about.png)

   *This Management Pack's vendor is 'VMware'*

6. `Enter a path to a EULA text file, or leave blank for no EULA`

   VMware Aria Operations requires a EULA file to be present in a Management Pack. If one isn't provided, a stub EULA file (`eula.txt` in
   the root project directory) will be added to the project which reads:
    ```
    There is no EULA associated with this Management Pack.
    ```

7. `Enter a path to the Management Pack icon file, or leave blank for no icon`

   The icon is used in the VMware Aria Operations UI if present. If it is not present, a default icon will be used. The icon file must be
   PNG format and 256x256 pixels. An icon file can be added later by copying the icon to the root project directory and
   setting the value of the `"pak_icon"` key to the icon's file name in the `manifest.txt` file.

For complete documentation of the `mp-init` tool including an overview of its output, see the [MP Initialization Tool Documentation](doc/mp-init.md).

### Template Project
Every new project creates a file system that has the basic project structure required to develop and build a Management Pack.
Each file and directory are discussed in depth in the [mp-init](doc/mp-init.md) documentation. `app/adapter.py` is the adapter's
entry point and the best starting point. `adapter.py` is a template adapter that collects several objects and metrics from the
container in which the adapter is running; use the template as a starting point for creating a new adapter. The template adapter 
has comments throughout its code that explain what the code does and how to turn it into your adapter. The methods inside the adapter
template are required. Modify the code inside the methods to generate the desired adapter. Each method represents a single request,
and it can be tested individually using `mp-test`, which is covered in the following section. The adapter is stateless; therefore,
the methods don't store any data for use in later method calls. Each method is used for a different function as described below:

- test(adapter_instance):
  Performs a test connection using the information given to the adapter_instance to verify the adapter has been set up properly.
  A typical test connection will generally consist of:

     1. Read identifier values from adapter_instance that are required to connect to the target(s)
     2. Connect to the target(s), and retrieve some sample data
     3. Disconnect cleanly from the target (ensure this happens even if an error occurs)
     4. If any of the above failed, return an error, otherwise pass.

- get_endpoints(adapter_instance):
  This method will be run before the 'test' method, and VMware Aria Operations will use
  the results to extract a certificate from each URL. If the certificate is not trusted by
  the VMware Aria Operations Trust Store, the user will be prompted to either accept or reject
  the certificate. If it is accepted, the certificate will be added to the AdapterInstance
  object that is passed to the 'test' and 'collect' methods. Any certificate that is
  encountered in those methods should then be validated against the certificate(s)
  in the AdapterInstance. This method will not only work against HTTPS endpoints, different types
  of endpoint will not work.

- collect(adapter_instance):
  Performs a collection against the target host. A typical collection will generally consist of:
    1. Read identifier values from adapter_instance that are required to connect to the target(s)
    2. Connect to the target(s), and retrieve data
    3. Add the data into a CollectResult's objects, properties, metrics, etc
    4. Disconnect cleanly from the target (ensure this happens even if an error occurs)
    5. Return the CollectResult.

- get_adapter_definition():
  Defines the object types and attribute types, and in most cases, it also defines the Adapter Instance configuration 
  parameters/credentials present in a collection. Setting these helps VMware Aria Operations to validate, process, and display the 
  data correctly.


For further guidance on using the template project, consult the [Walkthroughs](../README.md#walkthroughs) section.

### Testing a Management Pack

In the Management Pack directory, the installation script writes a `requirements.txt` file containing the version of the
SDK used to generate the project, and installs the SDK into a virtual environment named `venv`. Note that the packages
in `requirements.txt` are _not_ installed into the adapter. To add a package to the adapter, specify it in the file
`adapter_requirements.txt`.

To use the SDK, navigate to the newly-generated project directory and activate the virtual environment:

For Mac and Linux:
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```
(This script is written for the bash shell. If you use the csh or fish shells, there are alternate activate.csh and activate.fish scripts you should use instead.)
For Windows:
```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
To exit the virtual environment, run `deactivate` in the virtual environment.

To test a project, run `mp-test`  in the virtual environment.

If `mp-test` is run from anywhere outside of a root project directory, the tool will prompt to choose a project, and will
test the selected project. If the tool is run from a project directory, the tool will automatically test that project.

`mp-test` will ask for a _connection_. No connections should exist, so choose **New Connection**. The test tool then
reads the `conf/describe.xml` file to find the connection parameters and credentials required for a connection, and
prompts for each. This is similar to creating a new _Adapter Instance_ in the VMware Aria Operations UI. Connections are automatically
saved per project, and can be reused when re-running the `mp-test` tool.

> Note: In the template project, the only connection parameter is `ID`, and because it connects to the container it is running on, this parameter is not necessary; it is only there as an example, and can be set to any value. The template also implements an example Test Connection. If a Test Connection is run (see below), with the `ID` set to the text `bad`, then the Test Connection will fail.

The test tool also asks for the method to test. There are four options:

* Test Connection - This call tests the connection and returns either an error message if the connection failed, or an
  empty json object if the connection succeeded.
* Collect - This call test the collection, and returns objects, metrics, properties, events, and relationships.
* Endpoint URLs - This returns a list (possibly empty) of URLs that have distinct SSL certificates that VMware Aria Operations can ask
  the end user to import into the TrustStore.
* Version - This returns
  the [VMware Aria Operations Collector API](vmware_aria_operations_integration_sdk/api/vmware-aria-operations-collector-fwk2.json) version the
  adapter implements. The implementation of this method is not generally handled by the developer.

For more information on these endpoints, see
the [Swagger API documentation](vmware_aria_operations_integration_sdk/api/vmware-aria-operations-collector-fwk2.json). Each
response is validated against the API.

For complete documentation of the `mp-test` tool see the [MP Test Tool Documentation](doc/mp-test.md).

### Building and Installing a Management Pack
To build a project, run `mp-build`  in the virtual environment.

If `mp-build` is run from anywhere outside of a root project directory, the tool will prompt to choose a project, and will
build the selected project. If the tool is run from a project directory, the tool will automatically build that
project.

Once the project is selected (if necessary), the tool will build the management pack and emit a `pak` file which can be
installed on VMware Aria Operations. The `pak` file will be located in the project directory.

To install the `pak` file, in VMware Aria Operations navigate to **Data Sources &rarr; Integrations &rarr;
Repository** and click `ADD`. Select and upload the generated `pak` file, accept the README, and install the management pack.

To configure the management pack, VMware Aria Operations navigate to **Data Sources &rarr; Integrations &rarr;
Accounts** and click `ADD ACCOUNT`. Select the newly-installed management pack and configure the required fields. For
`Collector/Group`, make sure that a cloud proxy collector is selected. Click `VALIDATE CONNECTION` to test the connection.
It should return successfully, then click `ADD`.

By default, a collection will run every 5 minutes. The first collection should happen immediately, however newly-created
objects cannot have metrics, properties, and events added to them. After the second collection, approximately five
minutes later, the objects' metrics, properties, and events should appear. These can be checked by navigating to **
Environment &rarr; Object Browser &rarr; All Objects** and expanding the Adapter and associated object types and object.
