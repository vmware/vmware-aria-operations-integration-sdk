# Setup Tool
The setup tool generates a boilerplate project that contains all the requirements to develop a containerized adapter for vRealize Operations Manager. The containerized adapter has to be distributed in the for of a Management Pack. To build a Management Pack use the [build tool](../build/README.md).

## Requirements
- [python 3.3 or higher] (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Docker CLI 20.10.xx or higher] (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Base Container Image](https://harbor-repo.vmware.com/harbor/projects/1067689/repositories/vrops-adapter-open-sdk-server)

### Optional Requirements
- [Java Image](https://harbor-repo.vmware.com/harbor/projects/1067689/repositories/vrops-adapter-open-sdk-server/artifacts/sha256:1520f9a97fa32b34ccce6d9ad03cf4853edb8ec8b54d388a97f75197488e5b8f)
- [Powershell Image](https://harbor-repo.vmware.com/harbor/projects/1067689/repositories/vrops-adapter-open-sdk-server/artifacts/sha256:7290c2d23242620641cb162378e641f23d096b0d3339b466980f64217237b9b5)

## Prompts
- Project Directory
   - The _project directory_ where the boilerplate code for this project is going to reside. If the directory does not exist, it will be created. The boilerplate code includes a sample adapter.
- Display Name
   - The _display name_ used by vRealize Operations Manager as the name of the Management Pack generated by this project. The name should include the name of the Technology the Management Pack monitors.
- Description
   - A brief _description_ of Management Pack and the technology it monitors. The description should include relevant versions of the monitored technology.
- Company
   - The name of the company/developer of the adapter. vRealize Operations Manager will display this information during installation of the  Management Pack generated by this project.
- EULA
   - A text file that provides guidelines for the distribution and usage of the Management Pack generated by this project. The End-User Agreement, _EULA_, should be included with all distributable Management Packs. The content of this file appears in vRealize Operations Manager during installation of this management pack.
- Management Pack Icon
   - The _icon_ for the Management Pack generated by this project. The Icon will be displayed in vRealize Operations Manager. The icon image must be 256x256 pixels in PNG format.
- Language
   - The _language_ the sample Adapter will be written on. Supported languages should be on of the following:
	- Python
	- Java
	- Powershell

## Boilerplate Project Structure
- [Python Project](python_project.md) TODO Complete python_project.md documentation
- [Powershell Project](powershell_project.md) TODO Complete powershell_project.md documentation
- [Java Project](java_project.md) TODO Complete java_project.md documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Docker images not found

The Dockerfile generated by the setup tool references the `vrops-adapter-open-sdk-server`, so its important to have image available locally with the correct tags. To get the `vrops-adapter-open-sdk-server` locally  see the following:

   - _Building Images_ section in the main [documentation](../../README.md)
   - _Pulling Images_ section in the main [documentation](../../README.md)

### SyntaxError: invalid syntax
The error bellow is a sign that the wrong version of python is being used to run the setup script.
```
  File "tools/setup/main.py", line 12
    def is_directory_or_not_existing(p: str):
                                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Ensure the version of python that is being to run the script is python 3.3 or higher.
