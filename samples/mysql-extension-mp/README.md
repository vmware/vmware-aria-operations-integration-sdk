Sample Extension Management Pack
================================

This is a sample management pack that collects some data from MySQL and attaches them 
to objects created by the MySQL management pack.

For more information, see the [walkthrough section](../../README.md#creating-a-new-management-pack).

This sample can be used as-is, as a reference, or as a starting point for 
adding more or different data to the MySQL Management Pack.

Note: Running this Management Pack using `mp-test` requires a connection (via SuiteAPI) 
to a VMware Aria Operations instance running the MySQL Management Pack.  The 
connection is specified by setting SuiteAPI Connection Info when creating a 
New Connection in `mp-test`.
